# Timelapse

Use a raspberry pi 3 to capture images and upload them to s3 to be processed later

plan:

* capture image
* keep track of images captured
* upload to s3
* keep a count to have content to justify my purchase of the display-o-tron

maybes:

* when complete pull all images and process
* use python to create timelapse
* make the buttons on DoT do something?
